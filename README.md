# AI Mood Analyzer

This project is my playground for exploration and learning, aimed at gaining insights into new technologies.

### Tech Exploration
**Next.js:** Unleashing the power of the React framework for seamless and efficient web development.

**PostgreSQL:** Harnessing PostgreSQL for robust, optimized data storage.

**Tailwind CSS:** Designing responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach.

**Prisma:** Optimizing database access with the simplicity of Prisma.

**LangChain:** While LangChain boasts numerous advantages, for this project, its ability to dynamically access and process information proved invaluable. I leveraged this capability to seamlessly connect to my database, enabling on-demand retrieval of relevant data.

**GPT API:** GPT API brings intelligent and context-aware features to the project.




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
